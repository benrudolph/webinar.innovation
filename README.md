### Questions to panel

After seeing this video, IDEO makes going through the Innovation process easy and simple. In some ways though, innovating on a shopping cart is the ideal situation. In the beginning, IDEO goes through a phase of understanding their target user, ie the shopper. I'm interesting in hearing your experiences in understanding the user in situations where it might be more difficult than going to the nearest shopping mart. What challenges have you run into? How have you solved them?

Understanding the user is only half the battle. How do you iterate on your idea once you have it? Sometimes testing it on the community isn't an option, how do you adapt for this?

Rapid prototyping can be difficult if the idea isn't easily prototypable (such as ideas or systems, rather than products). What if any suggestions do you have for prototyping these harder, less tangible ideas?

Failure is a big part of succeeding. How do you tell when an innovation has failed? When do you scratch it and go back to the drawing board?

The man in the video speaks about hierarchy being inheritantly opposed to innovation. However, it's not always an option for us to ditch bureaucracy, especially in the UN. What are some tips to help mitigate bureaucracy or work with bureaucracy to foster innovation?

Lots of us have don't always have the ability to fully implement the innovation process within our unit. How can we bring the innovation process to our work in little ways?

What are some caveats to innovation process that we aren't always aware of?
